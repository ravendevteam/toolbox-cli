# Toolbox
Package manager for Raven software

## Installing
Download the release, open a command line and run `toolbox install toolbox`. If you don't want to install the app, just don't run the command.

## Multiple OS support
There is no support for macOS or Linux, but you can install most Raven apps manually on those platforms.
If there is demand for those platforms, we will consider porting Toolbox to them. Please create an issue if you want Toolbox on your platform.
